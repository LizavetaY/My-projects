3) When you click on the button, links from the first paragraph should be changed (add event). Also the links should be found by DOM navigation;
4) When the user clicks on the links from the second paragraph for the first time, they should be saved to the LocalStorage like an object looks like { path: 'https://google.com' }. And the alert should appear with text that the link was saved;
5) When the user clicks on the links from the second paragraph after that, and links are already saved to the LocalStorage, the alert should appear with the value of link;
